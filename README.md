  <h1 align="center">TypeScript Browser Development Template</h1>
  <h4 align="center">
    A template project for TypeScript based projects which are extensive and
    relies in many dependencies ready for development
  </h4>
</div>

## Motivation

Writing web applications rich in scripting and without using any UI libraries
or Frameworks, I noticed the boilerplate of this setup.

The need of using TypeScript to handle many type definitions, different
dependencies (lodash, three.js, axios), and have to bundle everything into a
set of JavaScript files turned into something very common for little while.

This template intention is to help me save some time and repetition while
using a development ready repository for these purposes.

## Development

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## Bundle

This project bundles into a set of JavaScript files, you can reuse the
`index.html` file in this project as a reference on how to include the bundle
into your project.

## License

Theres no license attached to this repository given that it is intended for
initialzing other projects.
